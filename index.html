		<h2> About me </h2><br>
			<p>A rising senior at Louisiana State University working towards two degrees in Electrical engineering and Computer Science,
			 I have a  passion for technology spanning across design and creation of circuits to software and development of programs. </p><br>
			 <p> I have interned with Chevron for 2 years, The first year I mainly spent analyzing application interfaces as well as integrations. 
			 The second year I spent working on automating deployment processes, working heavily with PowerShell and Jenkins. I am also a student worker
			 for the Physics department at my school, Louisiana State University. My experiences have afforded me the opportunity to grow proficiency in languages like
			 C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Batch scripting, PHP, MYSQL and work with various tools like MATLAB, Eagle, Jenkins, OpenCV, BASIC Stamp editor. My resume can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JI5MaVgr9qN3fAGAGbaiacrQYxUhVFHB">here. </a> </p><br>
			 <p> Outisde of school and work, I am an active member of  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) LSU chapter as well as the
				African Student Organization of which I am the director of communications. In my free time I enjoy working on personal projects and some of my
				hobbies include swimming and skating.</p><br>

				<h2> C.H.I.C.K: Climate High-altitude Instrumental Collection Kit </h2>
						<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Description</span>: CHICK is a device that is designed to Record external temperatures, air pressure, and humidity measurements as a function of altitude up to 100,000ft (30.48km). 
						Our team then compared recorded data to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Atmosphere">standard atmospheric model</a>Â to ensure the integrity of our data as a loose guide while 
						comparing slightly more intensely with the <a href="http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html"> University of Wyoming Sounding Balloon data.</a> which gives a more recent profile of these external variables.
						This proejct was sponsored by Louisiana State University as part of the <a href="http://laspace.lsu.edu/aces/">LaAces Program</a>.</p>

				<h2>Gun Head</h2>
						<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Description</span>:  Gun head is a class project developed for the object oriented Programming class (CSC 3380) at LSU. It is an arcade-style first person shooter game
							which uses a trained model for detecting faces in OpenCV to track a user and allow them to control an onscreen character. Our group used OpenCV
							for the face recognition model and used Unity as the game engine. The user plays as a crypt keeper whose objective is to kill as many zombies as 
							possible to break a high score.</p>
