						<h3> C.H.I.C.K: Climate High-altitude Instrumental Collection Kit </h3>
						<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Description</span>: CHICK is a device that is designed to Record external temperatures, air pressure, and humidity measurements as a function of altitude up to 100,000ft (30.48km). 
						Our team then compared recorded data to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Atmosphere">standard atmospheric model</a>Â to ensure the integrity of our data as a loose guide while 
						comparing slightly more intensely with the <a href="http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html"> University of Wyoming Sounding Balloon data.</a> which gives a more recent profile of these external variables.
						This proejct was sponsored by Louisiana State University as part of the <a href="http://laspace.lsu.edu/aces/">LaAces Program</a>.</p>

						<h3>Gun Head</h3>
						<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Description</span>:  Gun head is a class project developed for the object oriented Programming class (CSC 3380) at LSU. It is an arcade-style first person shooter game
							which uses a trained model for detecting faces in OpenCV to track a user and allow them to control an onscreen character. Our group used OpenCV
							for the face recognition model and used Unity as the game engine. The user plays as a crypt keeper whose objective is to kill as many zombies as 
							possible to break a high score.</p>

						<h3>LaAces Website</h3>
						<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Description</span>:  As a student worker, I work in the physics department at Louisiana State University, more specifically the Aerospace Catalyst Experiences for Students (ACES) department.
							Part of my responsibilities include creating and maintaining various pages. I use PHP scripts to pull from a MYSQL database and populate HTML templates. I create queries and update
						    the website as needed.</p>
